        <h1>Course description</h1>
        <p>
            <br> The course introduces concepts of concurrency and parallelism through the programming language Haskell.
            <br>
            <br> Concrete topics treated in this course include expicit management and synchronisation of threads, as well as higher-level concurrency and parallelism abstractions. These ideas appear not only in Haskell, but in other modern languages such as C#, Scala, and Swift. An important part of the course is devoted to <i>reasoning</i> about the properties of concurrent programs.
            <br>
            <br> The language Haskell imposes strong separation between <i>pure</i> computations, which are always safe to execute in parallel, and those with <i>side-effects</i>, which may result in non-deterministic behaviour when executed concurrently.
            <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Schedule</h2>
        <p>
            The load per week is 2 * 2 hour <a href="schedule">lectures</a> and 2 * 2 hour <a href="assignments">werkcollege</a>. Attendance is not strictly mandatory (albeit recommended).
            <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Grading</h2>

        <p>The final grade depends on the two exams and the assignments</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <i>theory</i> grade is T = 0.4 * grade of mid-term + 0.6 * grade of final exam. You need T >= 5 to pass the course.</li>
            <li>The <i>practical</i> grade P = 0.2 * first practical + 0.4 * second practical + 0.4 * third practical. You need P >= 5 to pass the course.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The final grade is computed as F = 0.5 * T + 0.5 * P. If you have done all of the practicals and at least one exam, then the final result of the course is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Passed with grade F (rounded to half points) if F ≥ 5.5 and T ≥ 5 and P ≥ 5.</li>
            <li>Not passed with grade 5.0 if F ≥ 5.5 but T &lt; 5 or P &lt; 5</li>
            <li>Not passed with grade F otherwise</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you have <i>not</i> submitted one of the practical assignments, or have not taken any of the exams, then the final result is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AANV if F >= 4</li>
            <li>NVD otherwise</li>
        </ul>
